Specifically, we will look at the All out 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, 00's, and 10's playlists created by Spotify. This should provide us with a sufficient overview of popular music in the last century.\n",

This can easily be found on the Spotipy website which I have linked at the end of this tutorial. The environment variables listed below are for my personal Spotify account. You will have your own."
