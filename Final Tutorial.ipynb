Specifically, we will look at the All out 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, 00's, and 10's playlists created by Spotify. This should provide us with a sufficient overview of popular music in the last century.\n",

This can easily be found on the Spotipy website which I have linked at the end of this tutorial. The environment variables listed below are for my personal Spotify account. You will have your own."

Thankfully, Spotify is thorough so the data we have is pretty complete and does not require much cleaning at all. One thing we will do is change the duration of the songs from milliseconds to seconds. We also have to adjust the typing of some of the categories so they can be graphed properly. Other than that, we have no NaN values to take care of and no strange data so we are ready to move on."
